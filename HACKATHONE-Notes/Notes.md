# Initial Draft
its an app that solvers the parking problem in the center of big cites or touristy areas like the beach its idea is simple lets say you go to the beach you need parking you go to the beach parking spot its full and very expensive what do you do then well our app solves this problem.
when using our app in your way to your desired spot you enter the spot in the map our algorithm take in consideration the following variables: closest parking to your spot with available parking spots (spots tracking system STS for partner parking and guaranteed for sponsored parking) and parking price and maps them for you, then you have the ability to pre-reserve a spot from the app (for partner parking and guaranteed for sponsored parking) .
##  regular parkings (white)
a regular parkings are just private parkings we map them for you and using ai and community driven surveys and reviews and crowd source data (trafic, time of the day...) we make predictions for the availability, pricing and security we provide this data in exchange of you providing more data about your parking experience.
##  partner parkings (blue)
a partnering parkings are usually unknown parkings or small residential private parkings or parkings in need of clients we provide them the clientele in return we take commission on the reservation from the client side and after we review there parking spot regards to security and we install a sensors in the door to track incoming cars and outgoing cars and with the spots of the parking we make more accurate predictions on how many available spots.
##  sponsored  parkings (gold)
a sponsored partings is a full on partnership we provide the tech the clientele and the digital management via a dashboard and guaranteed security and guaranteed availability also vip users (monthly subscription) get features like guaranteed spot in any golden parking in any city they go to and reputation via out app branding and they provided us with the building and funding it like a smart park this is more of a 50% partnership.

## Individuals Parking (maroon brown)
individuals rent out private spaces like the front of your house times were they do not use it like when they at work.

so in simple term its a platform based around the great map of parkings.

![[Parking Mo]]
# 1. Idea Summary:
**Parking Mo** is a mobile/web platform designed to alleviate chronic parking shortages—and sky-high fees—in dense urban or tourist hotspots (e.g., city centers, beaches) by aggregating four tiers of supply onto a single, intelligent map:

1. **Regular Parkings** (white): Mapped private lots with AI- and community-driven availability and pricing forecasts.

2. **Partner Parkings** (blue): Small residential or under-utilized lots outfitted with entry/exit sensors; drivers can reserve and pay per booking, the operator pays us commission.

3. **Sponsored Parkings** (gold): Full-service, high-visibility smart garages. We build/install sensors & dashboard, guarantee availability, share revenue 50/50, and VIP subscribers get guaranteed access city-wide.

4. **Individual Parkings** (maroon): Homeowners list their driveway or yard when unused.


On your way, you tap your destination in the app—our algorithm weighs distance, real-time occupancy (via STS sensors for partner/sponsored lots; AI-predictions for regular), dynamic pricing, and user-ratings—to show the best options. You can even pre-reserve/pay through the app, cutting cruising time and stress.

## 2. Ideas to Enhance & Differentiate
- **Dynamic Pricing & Surge Management**
    - Introduce minute-level price modulation: off-peak discounts for partner lots, surge pricing only when demand spikes (e.g., during festivals).
    
- **Extra Services **
    - Offer combined bundle: park + e-scooter/bike share or shuttle to last-mile destinations (beach, tourist sites), car cleaning services.
    
- **Green Parking**
	- Provide EV Charging spots.
    - Reward EV drivers or car-poolers with discounted rates or dedicated premium spots; integrate with EV-charging stations in sponsored garages.
    
- **Gamification & Loyalty**
    - “Park-Points” for each booking; redeem for discounted future parking, coffee vouchers at local cafés, or municipal transit passes.
    
- **Voice-Assistant & Navigation Plug-in**
    - Integrate with Google Maps / Waze so users can route directly to their reserved spot with turn-by-turn guidance.
    
- **Municipal Dashboard for City Planners**
    - Provide aggregated anonymized data on parking flows to help Tangier or Casablanca authorities optimize signage, curb-pricing and traffic policies.

- **release unused reservation**
    - Allow drivers to “release” their unused reservation at a discount and transfer it to a waiting list, maximizing utilization.

## Action Plan
### Phase 0: Kick-off & Setup (Day 1)
1. **Sprint Planning & Roles**
    - Hold a 2 hr kickoff to align scope, assign roles (IoT lead, front-end, back-end, UX/UI, product) and agree on tech stack (React + mock sensor API) [Agile Batman](https://agilebatman.com/a-typical-2-week-sprint-calendar-60304478651b?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
        
2. **Define MVP Scope**
    - Identify 3 core user flows: “Find & Filter Spots,” “Reserve & Pay,” and “Host Onboarding” [Relab Academy](https://academy.relab.com.au/design-thinking/how-to-design-an-mvp-for-an-app-in-2-weeks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
3. **Set Up Repo & Tooling**
    - Create GitHub repo, stub React/React Native app, and mock-API service (Node.js/Express) [Medium](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/mvp-in-agile-screw-the-mvp-build-incrementally-12d18c833ea7?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
4. **Canvas Business Model**
    - Quick one-page Lean Canvas: problems, solutions, key metrics, channels, revenue streams [Hackathon planning kit](https://hackathon-planning-kit.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
